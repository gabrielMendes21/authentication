# User authentication with NextJS
I just wanted to see how JWT works

> Status: finished ✔️

In this project, i used JSON Web Token to authenticate users and give them access to certain routes of the application. Also, i used React contexts to pass this token to all components of the page, and cookies to keep the token stored even if the page is closed. To keep users password safe, i used the Bcrypt library to encrypt all of them.
